# ColorGlossary

Project aimed at compiling a list of colors larger than that found on [Name That Color](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#6195ED), which maps approximately 1,500 colors to names. Since Resene has an updated color list as of today, my goal is to use this combined with Wikipedia and other sources to get a larger list of colors as well as provide multiple names for each color, and indicate how appropriate each name is.
